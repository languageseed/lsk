# Conversation Checkpoint Template
Copy and adapt this template to track your AI conversation state.

## Conversation State
**Current Focus**: 
<!-- Example: "Implementing user authentication service" -->
<!-- Example: "Debugging performance issue in dashboard component" -->
<!-- Example: "Refactoring payment processing module" -->

**AI Understanding**: 
<!-- What context has been shared with the AI: -->
<!-- Example: "AI knows about our Express.js setup, PostgreSQL schema, and existing user model" -->
<!-- Example: "Shared React component structure and state management patterns" -->
<!-- Example: "AI understands our microservice architecture and Docker deployment" -->

**Context Shared**:
<!-- Files, code snippets, or information provided to AI: -->
<!-- Example: "- UserService.ts implementation" -->
<!-- Example: "- API endpoint documentation" -->  
<!-- Example: "- Error logs from past 24 hours" -->
- 

## Progress Tracking
**Decisions Made**:
<!-- Key choices made during this conversation: -->
<!-- Example: "Use JWT tokens instead of sessions for scalability" -->
<!-- Example: "Implement retry logic with exponential backoff" -->
<!-- Example: "Extract user validation into separate service" -->
- 

**Problems Solved**:
<!-- Issues resolved in this conversation: -->
<!-- Example: "Fixed memory leak in file upload handler" -->
<!-- Example: "Clarified authentication flow requirements" -->
<!-- Example: "Identified root cause of database connection issues" -->
- 

**Blockers Encountered**:
<!-- Issues that need resolution before continuing: -->
<!-- Example: "Need clarification on password policy requirements" -->
<!-- Example: "Waiting for API documentation from third-party service" -->
<!-- Example: "Database migration needs approval before implementing schema changes" -->
- 

## AI Conversation Quality
**Effective Prompts Used**:
<!-- Prompts that worked well: -->
<!-- Example: "Generate a TypeScript service following our established patterns" -->
<!-- Example: "Debug this error by analyzing the stack trace and recent code changes" -->
<!-- Example: "Refactor this component to improve performance while maintaining functionality" -->
- 

**Context Gaps Identified**:
<!-- What the AI needs to know but hasn't been told: -->
<!-- Example: "AI doesn't know about our deployment pipeline constraints" -->
<!-- Example: "Missing context about legacy system integration requirements" -->
<!-- Example: "AI unaware of company security policies for data handling" -->
- 

**Conversation Adjustments Needed**:
<!-- How to improve future AI interactions: -->
<!-- Example: "Provide more specific examples when asking for code generation" -->
<!-- Example: "Share complete error messages, not just summaries" -->
<!-- Example: "Include business context when discussing technical decisions" -->
- 

## Next Steps
**Immediate Actions**:
<!-- What needs to happen next in this conversation: -->
<!-- Example: "Ask AI to implement the authentication middleware based on our discussion" -->
<!-- Example: "Get AI feedback on the proposed database schema changes" -->
<!-- Example: "Request code review of the refactored payment service" -->
- 

**Follow-up Questions**:
<!-- Questions to ask in next AI interaction: -->
<!-- Example: "How should we handle edge cases in the file upload process?" -->
<!-- Example: "What additional error handling should be added to the API endpoints?" -->
<!-- Example: "How can we improve test coverage for the new authentication flow?" -->
- 

**Context to Prepare**:
<!-- Information to gather for next conversation: -->
<!-- Example: "Gather performance metrics before optimization discussion" -->
<!-- Example: "Collect user feedback on current authentication flow" -->
<!-- Example: "Review similar implementations in other parts of codebase" -->
- 

## Conversation Metadata
- **Started**: <!-- Date/time conversation began -->
- **Last Updated**: <!-- When this checkpoint was last modified -->
- **Phase**: <!-- Current LSKv4 phase: definition, validation, implementation, etc. -->
- **Related Context Pack**: <!-- Link to relevant context.pack.yaml if used -->
- **Related Checkpoint**: <!-- Link to related LSKv4 phase checkpoint if exists -->

## Conversation History Summary
<!-- Brief summary of conversation flow: -->
<!-- Example: "Started with requirements clarification, moved to architecture discussion, now implementing core service logic" -->
<!-- Example: "Began with error investigation, identified root cause, now working on comprehensive fix" -->
<!-- Example: "Discussed refactoring approach, got AI recommendations, currently implementing suggested changes" -->

## Template Usage Notes
<!-- Remove this section when using the template -->

**When to Create**: 
- At natural conversation breaks (end of work session, before switching topics)
- When conversation becomes complex and you need to track state
- Before sharing conversation with team members
- When resuming work after a break

**How to Use**:
- Copy this template and fill relevant sections
- Update throughout long conversations
- Reference when starting new related conversations
- Share with team to maintain context continuity

**Benefits**:
- Maintains conversation continuity across sessions
- Helps onboard team members to ongoing AI conversations
- Improves AI interaction quality over time
- Provides audit trail of decisions and reasoning
