# LSKv4 - Phase Plan
# This file tracks the progress of contract implementation through the pipeline phases.

pipeline:
  mode: "strict"  # Options: strict, lenient, experimental
  contract_name: "{{contract_name}}"  # Replace with actual contract name

current_phase: "definition"  # Current active phase
