# LSK Core v5.0 Version History

current_version: "1.0.0"
last_updated: "2025-11-12"
status: "active"
codename: "The Foundation Release"

philosophy: |
  LSK Core v5.0 represents a fundamental shift: moving from versioned iterations 
  to a stable, foundational framework for AI-assisted development. This is the 
  "core" that all specialized LSK frameworks build upon.
  
  The framework continues to evolve with real-world experience, capturing 
  learnings from actual practice, not theory.
